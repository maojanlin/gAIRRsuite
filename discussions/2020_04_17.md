### BLASTn-based allele calling

- Allele lengths are not considered. A long allele tends to have more supportive reads and is more favored than short ones, which is baised.

- Many alleles are similar, and thus can affect calling results. It is desirable to identify a family of alleles based on BLASTn results, and then perform more precise analysis.


### Methods other than BLASTn

- We may try to index reads as a ``reference'', and align alleles against it. It is assumed that any true allele is very likely to be contained by a single read, since the read length in our experiment is higher than most TCR/BCR alleles'.

- The drawback of this method is losing the ability of finding novel alleles.

## Usage
**Generate search patterns for haptamer and nonamer**

Process heptamer/nonamer sequences from database and generate pattern for `grep`.
The search pattern includes both forward and reverse sequences.

`python process_rss_for_grep.py -f <seq.txt>` 

**Find reads carrying either haptamer or nonamer using grep**

Find reads carrying either heptamer or nonamer (both forward and reverse).
Using `grep` for fast screening.

`sh exact_filter.sh <input.fastq> <filtered.fastq>`

**Find potential RSS by looking at the distance between heptamer and nonamer**

Find reads carrying both heptamer and nonmaer, and their distance is close to either 12-bp or 23-bp.
The tolerance of distance can be set by argument `-t` , which we recommend to be `0` since further analysis doesn't support `t > 0`.
The output of this script is a list of read names that potentially carrying a recombination signal sequences (RSS).

`python find_rss.py [-t INT] -f <filtered.fastq> -o <rss.names>`
